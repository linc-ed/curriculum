Is it simple and not too complicated? Mies van der Rohe liked things to be simple and neat, so you want your playhouse to be that way too.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Check the Materials:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think about what materials you want to use. Mies van der Rohe liked using strong and clear materials, like really clear windows. Maybe you can use materials that are tough and see-through, like plastic or glass.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make Sure It&#39;s Easy to Play In:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test if it&#39;s easy to play inside the playhouse. Can you move around easily? Mies van der Rohe wanted people to feel comfortable in the spaces he designed, so you want your playhouse to be super comfy for playing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Try Different Furniture:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think about what furniture to put in your playhouse. Mies van der Rohe designed cool furniture too, like fancy chairs. Try different types of chairs and tables to see which ones make your playhouse look amazing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>See How the Light Comes In:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mies van der Rohe liked sunlight coming into his buildings. Check if the sunlight comes into your playhouse in a nice way. Maybe you can have big windows or openings for the sunlight to shine in.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ask Your Friends for Ideas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get your friends to play in your playhouse and ask them what they think. Do they like how it looks? Is it easy to play in? Your friends might have awesome ideas to make your playhouse even better!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make Changes if Needed:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If something doesn&#39;t feel right, don&#39;t worry! You can change it. Mies van der Rohe always made sure everything looked perfect, so you can keep trying different things until your playhouse is just the way you want it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, testing mock-ups is like trying out different versions of your playhouse until you find the one that&#39;s the most fun, comfortable, and looks the coolest!</p>"
